# Documentation
## How to visualise the documentation
There is a file named `index.html` in this folder. Open it with your favorite web browser and then you can navigate through the documentation freely.
## Organisation
Each major part of the code shall (idealy) have its page with the appropriate documentation. So a lot of .html file may be in this folder.
